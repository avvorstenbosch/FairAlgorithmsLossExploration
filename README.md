# Fair Algorithms from the Loss Function - Exploratory Project
![Alt text](./PruleFairness.png?raw=true "Fairness in predictions for sensitive attributes")  
This repository is about the exploration of implementing fairness metrics in the loss functions of neural networks.
The inspiration for this project came from a adversarial fairness project by [GoDataDriven](https://godatadriven.com/blog/towards-fairness-in-ml-with-adversarial-networks/).
